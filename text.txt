New Year Resolutions.
There are two common detours that people tend to make before they even start to set their New Year resolutions. First, they think about what they should do, rather than what they really want to do. Second, they think about what they should stop doing, rather than what they want to achieve.
To be successful at any change, you need to really want it. Unless you take the time to consider what it is you really want, you could make a resolution to which you're not entirely committed.
New Year resolutions can be powerful because making them is such a well-recognized practice. Everyone knows that everyone else is making plans. And what a great mutual support network that can provide!
This external motivation and support, along with your desire to succeed is what can make the difference between success and failure.
